# Emulator

![Tetris](https://github.com/samukallio/retro-z80/blob/main/media/tetris.png?raw=true)

This is a software emulator for the hardware, built using the Z80Ex CPU emulator library.
The video circuit is emulated in a high-level way, enough to support VRAM scrolling, but
not cycle-accurate by any means. Controller input port 2 is mapped to the keyboard (see
below for the keybindings). Simple save-state support is implemented.

The emulator accepts the binary images generated by Pasmo (see `software/` for details on
how to build the system software). For emulator use, the image should be built in ROM mode.

## Controls

* Directional: Up/Down/Left/Right
* Action: Space
* Select: Enter
* Save state: F1
* Load state: F2

## Building

To build the emulator, extract the SDL2 source distribution into the `sdl2/` subdirectory, and then invoke CMake:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
After the project build files have been generated, build the project using the platform compiler toolkit.
